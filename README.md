# PiP Tool
PiP Tool is a Safari extension built to add the Picture-in-Picture functionality to YouTube in macOS Sierra.

YouTube doesn't have the default HTML5 video player, so Safari cannot add the PiP button. This is where PiP Tool comes in place.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to Safari -> Preferences -> Advanced
3. Check the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" if not checked
4. Go to Develop -> Allow Unsigned Extensions
5. Go to Develop -> Show Extension Builder
6. Click the "+" sign in bottom left corner
7. Select the clonned folder from Step 1
8. Enjoy

## Improvements
- Find a new icon for the project
- Change the base64-encrypted icon with a SVG
- Make it work with all the YouTube videos in a page (for multiple embedded videos on same page)

## Changelog
### Version 1.0
- Initial release
